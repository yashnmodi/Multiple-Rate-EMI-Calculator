# Multiple-Rate-EMI-Calculator
This repo contains java Swing GUI application which is made for variable interest rate EMI calculator. This repo conatins java classes as well as jar file and command line file(without GUI)too.

In repo, CLI files contain D.java which is the core program of Variable rate EMI calculation. I have made this program from the question asked
in CodeVita 2018 round 1.

This same is implemented using JAVA SWING GUI in netbeans. There is also a .jar file in dist folder.
